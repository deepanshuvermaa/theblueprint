# THE BLUEPRINT

A 30-day habit tracking app designed to help you build lasting habits across four core pillars: Physical, Mental, Social, and Wealth.

## What is this?

This is a personal project I built to track my own habits and stay consistent. The idea is simple - commit to 30 days of daily habits, and watch your progress compound over time. The app uses a progressive unlock system where you start with basic habits and unlock more advanced ones as you prove consistency.

## Features

- **Four Pillars System**: Track habits across Physical, Mental, Social, and Wealth categories
- **Progressive Unlocking**: Complete streaks to unlock advanced habits and tools
- **Built-in Tools**: Includes protein calculator, hydration tracker, meditation timer, reading tracker, and more
- **Visual Progress**: Heatmap calendar, streak tracking, and stats dashboard
- **Offline First**: Works completely offline using IndexedDB for data storage
- **Dark Mode**: Clean, minimalist design that's easy on the eyes

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Zustand for state management
- IndexedDB for local storage
- React Router for navigation

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## How it Works

1. Complete your onboarding to set personal goals
2. Start with 10 basic habits (5 for each pillar)
3. Check off habits daily to build streaks
4. Unlock advanced habits after hitting 10-day streaks
5. Access special tools and features as you progress

The app stores all your data locally in your browser - no accounts, no servers, just your personal progress.

## Why I Built This

I wanted a simple, no-nonsense habit tracker without subscriptions, ads, or unnecessary features. Just a clean tool that helps you stay accountable and build better habits.
